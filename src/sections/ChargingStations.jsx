                PPEM is committed to expanding Nigeria's electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
                 Over the next three years, we plan to deploy 10,000 charging stations across the
                 country, ensuring convenient and reliable access to charging facilities for EV
                 owners. We invite property owners to partner with us in hosting charging stations
                 to maximize convenience and promote EV adoption.
